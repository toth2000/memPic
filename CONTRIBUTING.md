# Contributing Guidelines  
  
This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process.

We are happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to improve this project. Thank you for helping out and remember, **no contribution is small.** 
- Before opening a new issue, please **check** if it is already created or not.
- Pull requests will be merged after being **reviewed and tested**.
- Create a pull request from a **branch** other than `master`,that means you have to create a new branch for every pull request.
- The `master` branch contains all client side ReactJs code.
- The folder `server` contains all server-side NodeJs and ExpressJs code. This branch will be deployed and connected to `HEROKU` later.
- If your code is breaking mention it in the pull request.

### For any queries or discussions, please create a new discussion under the **Discussions** tab.
